Since high school, some of my most prominent community roles have been my achievement of Eagle Scout, my involvement as a tutor and mentor for younger students through 121-Reach, and my role as Events Coordinator Apprentice in the University of Georgia's Filipino Student Association.<br><br> For my Eagle Scout project, I built an outdoor learning area for Johns Creek United Methodist Church's preschool as well as restored a nearby walkway and multiple picnic tables to their original conditions. The project demanded approximately 80 hours of planning, leading, and communicating on my part and spent 9 months in development. </p> </div> <figure> <img src="walkway.f15d6505.jpg" alt="walkway" width="361" height="271"> <figcaption>A restored walkway, part of my Eagle Scout project</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div id="passions"> <div> <h2>Interests and Passions</h2> <p> When I'm not studying for my classes, you can find me on the soccer pitch where I've been playing for over 10 years, on my computer studying the financial markets and investing, or at a cafe developing my computer science skills and knowledge. <br><br> I am a self-taught computer scientist who enjoys JavaScript, Swift, and HTML and building projects (such as the one you're viewing right now!) with those langauges to expand on my programming abilities. All of the programming knowledge that I have gained has been through independent study and a result of hardwork and dedication to broadening my skills. </p> </div> <figure> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MatthewCWoodward/evolution-app"><img src="iPhoneApp.7d17df4f.png" alt="image of iPhone app" width="361" height="206"></a> <figcaption>An iOS app I built to teach students about the evolutionary ancestors of modern humans</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div id="future"> <div> <h2>Future Career Goals</h2> <p> Through my career, I hope to obtain a position which allows me to combine my passions for computer science and business. I believe that I would thrive as a data scientist or computer and information system manager, where I would have the unique ability to understand the goals of the organization from both the technical and business aspects of a situation. </p> </div> </div> <div id="other-projects"> <div> <h2>Follow My Other Projects!</h2> <p> If you enjoyed this website, you can check out its source code and structure as well as more of my projects on my <a class="dark-text" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MatthewCWoodward">GitHub profile!</a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <p> Made by Matthew Woodward </p> <p> See the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MatthewCWoodward/personal-site">GitHub repo</a> </p> </footer> <script src="js.c08810f5.js"></script> </section> </main>
