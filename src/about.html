							<h2>Community Involvement</h2>
							<p>
								Being an active and helping member within my communities is something that I strive for wherever I go. Since high school, some of my most prominent community roles have been my achievement of Eagle Scout, my involvement as a tutor and mentor for younger students through 121-Reach, and my role as Events Coordinator Apprentice in the University of Georgia's Filipino Student Association.<br><br>
								For my Eagle Scout project, I built an outdoor learning area for Johns Creek United Methodist Church's preschool as well as restored a nearby walkway and multiple picnic tables to their original conditions. The project demanded approximately 80 hours of planning, leading, and communicating on my part and spent 9 months in development.

							<h2>Interests and Passions</h2>
							<p>
								When I'm not studying for my classes, you can find me on the soccer pitch where I've been playing for over 10 years, on my computer studying the financial markets and investing, or at a cafe developing my computer science skills and knowledge. <br><br>
								I am a self-taught computer scientist who enjoys all different kinds of programming languages and building projects (such as the one you're viewing right now!) with those langauges to expand on my programming abilities. This website was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I am currently learning Rust! All of the programming knowledge that I have gained has been through independent study and a result of hardwork and dedication to broadening my skills.

							<h2>Future Career Goals</h2>
							<p>
								Through my career, I hope to obtain a position which allows me to combine my passions for computer science and business. I am drawn to operations & supply chain management because I believe my ability to approach business situations in the field will be greatly enhanced by my ability to utilize and take advantage of relevant technologies.
